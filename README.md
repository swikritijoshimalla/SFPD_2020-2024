# SFPD_2020-2024
San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) incident reports (2020-2024) to identify, visualize, and forecast crime patterns across city neighborhoods.

**About the Project**
This capstone project analyzes five years of San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) incident reports (2020–2024) to identify, visualize, and forecast crime patterns across city neighborhoods. Although seven years of data were available, the most recent five were selected for relevance and accuracy. The project aims to uncover cyclical trends in crime frequency and location to support data-driven public safety planning and promote informed community decision-making.

Using tools such as Python, ArcGIS, Tableau, and statistical modeling, the team examines how factors like time of day, season, and neighborhood characteristics influence crime activity. Predictive modeling techniques—including clustering and regression analysis—are applied to forecast high-risk zones and evaluate how patterns shift over time. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) combines visualizations and correlation mapping to highlight relationships between crime types, time, and geography, while ethical frameworks guide the project to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in interpreting policing data.

The project deliverables include an in-depth research paper, interactive ArcGIS maps, and visual dashboards that make the findings accessible to both technical and public audiences. These tools are designed to encourage dialogue on equity, safety, and the responsible use of data science in urban policy and management.


**Project Team**
This project was developed by Swikriti Joshi and Eduardo Rosas, graduate students in the Big Data Analytics program at San Diego State University. Their shared goal is to apply data science and visualization techniques to real-world challenges, using open data to promote transparency, ethical analysis, and community engagement.
